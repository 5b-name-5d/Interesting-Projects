# Interesting-Projects
This repository is for some projects that I work on for fun, but other people might like, such as an OS created in Java
specifically for the Rasberry Pi, or fonts such as "Arial" or "Trebuchet MS" converted into a monospace format (both
work-in-progress).
Just like my last two repositories, please give me credit for my work.
